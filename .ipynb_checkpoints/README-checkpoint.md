# Module-6-Python-API-Challenge

Beginning with WeatherPy, we first need to import multiple libraries to acquire the appropriate functions to use. Then we can begin to gather the data: by using a for loop and empty lists, we are able to create a list both for the city name and its longitude and latitude coordinates. In the next step, OpenWeatherAPI is used to generate the stats of each city in the list that was created, and we can enter this data into a dataframe for future use. We can narrow down the data into the columns we want to chart, mainly latitude against a number of other factors (humidity, cloudiness, temperature, wind speed). Finally these charts are further broken down between northern and southern hemispheres and all have been given linear regression lines.

With VacationPy, we use the same city stats dataframe created in WeatherPy, but it is visualized by a map instead of a chart. Then we can narrow down the dataframe further by using subjective opinions of ideal weather conditions. From here, Geoapify is used to find the first hotel within 10,000m of these cities, using a for loop and setting parameters for the API to navigate through. These hotels will be printed and processed into a new dataframe that is visualized by another map.
